Thank you for downloading Glocks public 3ft pack. With the news of 3ft becoming a thing after a long time of talking I figured making a public pack for 3ft would be a good idea as at the time of this being typed and uploaded, there are no premade 3ft rolling stock locos or public 3ft locos or rolling stock.  I have been working with Dan from trainz forge of several pieces in this pack and I can't thank him enough.

Disclaimers and one thing I ask you not to do

With these being prop to meshed locos and stock that were modeled in Blender, the load time might take a while (same with the load time) but with doing this I've been able to do super detailed optimized locos with this. There might be a little bit of lag when loading the loco in but it goes away after all the p2mâ€™s are loaded, Also the reason there are so many p2m gates is so users may be able to customize the loco to how they want (dif headlights, stacks,pilots,tender loads,cabs,etc)

The one thing I ask is you don't remove the builder plate



Let's get to the fun parts
